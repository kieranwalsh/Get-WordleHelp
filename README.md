# Get-WordleHelp
This is a simple little script that downloads an online Scrabble five-letter wordlist and allows you to narrow down all the possible solutions from the guesses you've already made.

The important switches are:
-KnownLetters: The letters that you know are in the word.
-ExcludedLetters: The letters that are not in the word.
-Positions: Enter your 'Green' letters in this format *Z****, where 'Z' is the only green letter on your line.

This is what it looks like while running, but you no longer need to use commas to separate the letters.
